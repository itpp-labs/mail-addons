Further information
-------------------
Due to odoo restrictions, module makes mail initialization again. That is browser loads emoji and other chat data twice. This is the only way to make Mail feature extendable.

One can say, that the module do this todo from `addons/mail/static/src/js/chat_manager.js <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/9.0/addons/mail/static/src/js/chat_manager.js#L57>`__

    // to do: move this to mail.utils
